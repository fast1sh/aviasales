# Aviasales React app [(live demo)](https://aviasales.netlify.com/) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/01dab959-d472-4bc6-ad5d-37554236012d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aviasales/deploys)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
SPA with tickets cards and a filter. Price currency can be switched. Tickets can be filtered by a count of plane transfers.
* Tickets are taken from local [json](https://github.com/fast1sh/aviasales/blob/master/public/data/tickets.json) with artificial time delay.
* Exchange rates are taken from remote [daily json](https://www.cbr-xml-daily.ru/daily_json.js).

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`
Installs required dependencies.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
